## Why Use a GUI?

Writing JSON Schemas by hand is a slow, error-prone process. Even in a modern IDE with AI assistance, you're still just manipulating text. It's easy to get lost in nested brackets, miss a comma, or forget a specific validation keyword.

This JSON Schema Builder is a **power tool** that solves these problems by providing:

*   **A Visual & Structural Overview:** Stop scrolling through endless lines of JSON. The GUI provides a clear, hierarchical view of your schema's structure. Collapse what you don't need, expand what you're working on, and never lose your place.
*   **Accelerated Workflow:** Drastically reduce the time it takes to create complex schemas. The guided interface is simply faster than typing boilerplate by hand.
*   **Error-Free Syntax:** The builder generates 100% valid syntax in real-time. Focus on your schema's logic, not on hunting down bugs.
*   **First-Class LLM Support:** The "Function" root type is a purpose-built feature to generate schemas that are perfectly compatible with OpenAI's function calling API, making it trivial to define tools for your AI agents.

## Key Features

*   üé® **Visual Hierarchy:** A true GUI to add, edit, and reorder properties with a few clicks.
*   üß™ **UI Density Control:** Choose between Comfortable, Compact, and Dense layouts to suit your workflow.
*   ü§ñ **LLM Function Calling Mode:** A dedicated mode to correctly structure `name`, `description`, and `parameters` for OpenAI models.
*   üêç **Pydantic Model I/O:** Instantly generate a Pydantic `BaseModel` from your schema for use in Python backends. You can also import a schema directly from Pydantic source code.
*   üîÑ **Real-time Generation:** Your schema is updated and validated with every change.
*   üìë **Multi-Tab Interface:** Work on multiple schemas in the same session.
*   üì• **Import/Export:** Import existing JSON to kickstart your work, or export your final schema as a `.json` file.
*   üìã **Copy to Clipboard:** Instantly copy the entire schema or JSON for a specific property.
*   üèóÔ∏è **Complex Type Support:** Full support for `object`, `array`, `oneOf`, and reusable `$defs`.
*   üåô **Light & Dark Modes:** A professional UI that's comfortable day or night.
*   üíæ **Persistent State:** Your work is automatically saved in your browser's local storage.
*   üì¶ **Static & Portable:** Run the live version or host it yourself after a simple build process.
*   ‚û§ **Drag & Drop:** Easily reorder properties within an object.

## How to Use

1.  **Open the Live Demo:** Navigate to the application in your browser.
2.  **Choose a Root Type:** Select "object" for a standard JSON schema or "function" for an LLM tool definition.
3.  **Build Your Schema:**
    *   Use the controls on the left panel to add properties, define types, and fill in details like descriptions and validation rules.
    *   For nested objects or arrays, simply add a property and set its type to `object` or `array` to reveal nested controls.
4.  **View the Output:**
    *   The right panel displays the generated JSON schema, which updates instantly.
5.  **Export or Copy:**
    *   Use the buttons at the top of the right panel to `Copy` the schema to your clipboard or `Export` it as a file.

## For Developers

This project uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as a build tool to handle modern JavaScript modules and Tailwind CSS compilation. You must use the Node.js package manager (`npm`) to run the application locally.

### Running Locally

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/anusarati/json-schema-builder.git
    cd json-schema-builder
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Start the Development Server:**
    This server features hot-reloading, so changes you make to the source code will be reflected in the browser instantly.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
4.  **Open the Application:**
    The command will output a local URL in your terminal, typically `http://localhost:5173`.

### Building for Production

When you are ready to deploy the application (e.g., to GitHub Pages), you can create an optimized, static build.

1.  **Run the Build Command:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
2.  **Deploy the `dist` Directory:**
    This command creates a `dist` folder containing the minified and optimized application. You can deploy the contents of this `dist` folder to any static web hosting service like GitHub Pages, Vercel, or Netlify.
